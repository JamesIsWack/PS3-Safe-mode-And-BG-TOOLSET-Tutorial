        <p>First step, is to power off the console, if it is on. Next, hold the power button down until it turns off again. After this is done, hole the button again until you hear two consecutive beeps (e.g. first inital power on beep, then two quick beeps). Release the button, and plug in a DUALSHOCK 3 controller. To update, select Install System Software from the list. Using a USB Flash drive, aquire the choosen firmware from <a href="https://archive.midnightchannel.net/SonyPS/Firmware/?cat=evilnat">here.</a></p>
            <p>Rename the downloaded file to PS3UPDAT.PUP</p>
                <p>Once that is done, make a new folder on the USB device on the root named PS3, and a folder inside that named UPDATE. Put the PS3UPDAT.PUP file in the UPDATE folder, and insert the device into the PLAYSTATION3.</p>
                    <p>After that, select Install System Software from the choices provided in Safe Mode. Let it scan the device. Once it is done, it should prepare, and then reboot. Once it has rebooted, you should see a screen asking to press the PS BUTTON. Do so, and then follow the on screen instructions.</p>

                <p>First, go to http://stora.mooo.com/ in the PLAYSTATION 3's browser. This should be located under Network on the XMB (PS3s main interface). Open Internet Browser, and let it load. once done press START on the controller, and enter this URL: http://stora.mooo.com/</p>
                    <p>After you are at the website, it should ask for a username and password.</p>

                                <p>DISCLAIMER: DO NOT SHARE THIS WEBSITE, OR CREDENTIALS, WITH ANYONE.</p>
                                    <p>Once you are in the toolset, it should load. If it doesn't, and asks to load the plugin, check "Do not display again" and answer "Yes". Navigate to Console Manager. Let it extract the contents of dev_flash, and when it is finished, scroll down until you see "Flash Memory Patch". Press X on it and select "Load Patch via HTTPS". Once it is done, click X on the Close button in the dialog. Now for the risky part. Go back to Flash Memory Patch, this time selecting "Apply Loaded Patch".</p>
                                        <p><FONT COLOR="red">AGREE TO THE DIALOG, AND CONTINUE. DO NOT POWER OFF THE CONSOLE OR EXIT THE WEB BROWSER DURING THIS PROCESS, DOING SO WILL CAUSE A IRECOVERABLE BRICK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</FONT></p>
                                            <p>Once it has finished patching, and tells you "Console can now be restarted", you can install CFW!</p>
